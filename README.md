# ExtinguishX - Fire Fighting Robot using Arduino

## Description

**ExtinguishX** is an autonomous fire-fighting robot developed using Arduino. Designed to detect and extinguish all small fires using IR flame sensors and a servo-mounted pump, the robot can be used in fire-safety demonstrations, educational institutions, and prototype industrial safety automation. The aim is to enhance urban safety and environmental protection by integrating advanced eco-friendly technologies into firefighting vehicles. 


## Why We Made It

Fire safety is a critical need, and early response can prevent large-scale damage. **ExtinguishX** is built to explore how embedded systems and automation can help improve fire hazard responses. This robot demonstrates a smart, low-cost solution with potential for scalability.
